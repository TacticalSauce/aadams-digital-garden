> Unfortunately, one of the main obstacles we face when we try to examine the mind is a deep-seated and often unconscious conviction that "we're born the way we are and nothing we can do can change that." I experienced this same sense of pessimistic futility during my own childhood, and I've seen it reflected again and again in my work with people around the world. Without even consciously thinking about it, the idea that we can't alter our minds blocks our every attempt to try.
\- Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche
