## Notes on Pat's Speech

### Being a Great Musician

- entails studying the intersection of the brain and the soul #topic/religion/the-soul 
- a goal of max consciousness #topic/philosophy/consciousness is essential
- a way of life rather than a destination
	- looking at musical creativity in the broadest possible sense
	- embracing the potential of all genres of personal interest
	- getting to a place of freedom
	- sharing a way of being in the music that reflects one's best hopes and dreams to listeners
- playing every night for over 45 years has been pat's only path to real musical understanding
- inventing melodies on the spot at a high level within a complex harmonic framework isn't easy, but the fundamentals of how it works can be compared to learning a language #topic/language are are somewhat quantifiable in almost linguistic terms
- while fluency is an important factor, it's not enough to be able to generate new material night after night; a deeper view of life is required
	- nightly, issues of consciousness, free will, and how they intersect with empathy, shared language, politics, and musical imagination are contempated
		- #topic/philosophy/free-will #topic/science/psychology/emotion/empathy #topic/politics 
	- the most important factor is the soul
		- hardest element to quantify
		- while pat is a huge proponent of the scientific method, he emphasizes that there are unquantifiable experiences which play an even bigger role in his music and regular life
- in the modern world, where things of true value are conflated with almost anything else, pat does his best to maintain an objective attitude formed solely through his understanding of music

### Musical Improvization

- carries a mystical quality to it
- the science behind it is almost as fascinating to pat as the result
	- how does this actually occur?
	- what is it that happens when people improvize together night after night?
- understanding musical improvization as a layperson
	- we are all improvizing all the time
		- in each moment we have a general sense of what might happen
		- however, we must rely on past experience/skills developed to negotiate those moments
	- closest parallel for laypeople is language, particularly storytelling
	- has a lot in common w any job that entails a great deal of troubleshooting
- mastering the skill of musical improvization
	- "no better laboratory for examining consciousness"
	- the stage is a place of R&D; a centre for musical insight
	- most important factors:
		- #topic/qualities/flexibility 
		- #topic/qualities/maturity 
		- #topic/qualities/humour 
		- #topic/qualities/resilience 
		- the key quality is listening #topic/qualities/observation 
	- studying what's going on around the music that helps pat play best
		- keeps a journal of every night he's performed
		- while external conditions such as the audience, room, acoustics, etc have an impact, they are less important than one might assume
- the highest level of experience during musical improvization
	- simultaneous engagement/detachment
		- being in the moment at the most micro-level possible, simultaneously being essentially almost removed from it
	- at his best he feels like he isn't even doing anything
		- asks himself from a third-person perspective what he'd like to hear himself play, and plays that
		- being a listener/fan of music first
	- can fit some descriptions of mystical experiences #topic/religion/mystical-experiences 
	- pat believes this state can happen on a far more repeatable basis after years of practice
		- by trying to make sense of the process he's able to more consistently be in that state
		- increases his chances of being able to improvize at the level he aspires towards
	- "consciousness disappears completely when you get to your best moment on stage"

## Personal Notes

### Points of Interest

- understanding what Pat means by "the soul"
- the connection between consciousness, free will, empathy, shared language, politics, and musical imagination
- the connection between musical improvization and other forms of improvization such as learning a language or a job which entails a lot of troubleshooting
	- what lessons can we learn from masters of musical improvization which can be applied to improvization in general life?
- the connection between Pat's description of the highest levels of experience during musical improvization and meditation #topic/meditation 
	- simultaneous engagement/detatchment
- the objective science of musical improvization

### My Thoughts

- what Pat says about simultaneous engagement/detachment seems to me almost definitely related to the Buddhist understanding of meditation, such as what Mingyur Rinpoche describes #people/yongey-mingyur-rinpoche
