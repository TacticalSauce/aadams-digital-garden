- 14:00 ~ 14:20 (20 mins)
	- type: sound meditation
	- mind notes:
		- lots of thoughts, but I was able to sit back and watch them like a movie
		- sometimes there are noticeable periods of calm where my thoughts subside
		- however, there was also dullness after a certain point and I didn't want to fall asleep so I stopped the session
- informal meditation examples:
	- while showering
	- while working at my friends place
	- while walking to buy some things from dollarama
	- while eating pizza 
	- body scans before sleeping
