- 14:00 ~ 15:30 (1 hour 30 mins)
	- type: sound meditation
	- mind notes:
		- quite distracted by my own thoughts
		- still, I remembered to come back to sound quite frequently so the session was still fruitful
		- towards the 1 hour things started to settle down and after that things felt very clear and focused rather than scattered
