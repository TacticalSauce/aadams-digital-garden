- after this point my meditation journal pretty much ends, since I wasn't writing my regular personal journal either
- however, I continued to meditate everyday
- I experienced some difficult personal circumstances which have really tested my resilience
- coming back to the last few entries I wrote now I see them as the calm before the storm
- I figured it'd be better use of my time to describe the journey of meditation rather than focusing on each individidual experience at this point anyways
- to that end, I decided to write a philosophical entry to try and talk about some of the lessons I learned and how I dealt with the challenges

## Reflections

- one of the biggest tools I had through these experiences was the ability to see my mental narratives for what they are and confront my emotions and feelings directly
- I realized that challenges only serve to make us stronger in the end, but that at first it feels depressing
- I reaffirmed to myself that there is no point punishing oneself for feeling attachment and fear, and that just because I am not yet free of attachments doesn't mean I will never be
- I reminded myself of this with a Buddhist proverb that says peackocks eat poison and the poison they eat is tranformed into beautiful feathers
	- I needed to remember that ignorance, attachment, and the subsequent fear of loss cycling with hope that I can hold onto the way things were are the material I have been given to work with, and is actually a blessing in disguise: a chance to gain confidence, resilience, and life experience, growing in maturity
- I also had to remind myself that the confidence, resilience, and experience confronting impermanence and attachment have great potential to strengthen and grow my spiritual practise; equal to the ability they possess to cause suffering, and make me feel weak, incomplete, or incapable
	- it is all a matter of perception; suffering and contentment are just points of view to describe the same or similar basic experiences; nothing fundamental changes, yet the whole way you relate to your life experiences naturally shifts
	- in life, I have to deal with challenges and accept the circumstances, and ultimately make wise and compassionate decisions

### Attachment

- attachment is like an addictive cycle
	- the more I chase the objects of my attachment, the more I feel unsatiated just living with my own mind as it is naturally
	- I loose the ability to distinguish between the bare experience of happiness and whatever objects bring temporary happiness
	- thus, I become dependent on the object, and reinforce the neuronal conditioning which limits me to relying on an external source of hapiness
- however, I learned that attachment isn't really external; it's actually more connected to the narrative I create interally
- I was able to observe the kind of conditional view of myself I have created in my narrative: "I'm fine if I have this," or "this is bad but at least I have this so I can still be satisfied"
	- observing these things was a big step towards breaking the cycle of attachment and letting go

### Non-Attachment

- for me to break free of the cycle of attachment I decided that I needed to accept impermanence, and observe my mind as it engaged in grasping
	- grasping felt like an immediate response to the basic condition of impermanence, instictively driving me to defend myself by making the objects of attachment last
- I also had to learn not to fight against grasping or allow myself to succumb to believing in the story it tells me of what external things must change for me to be content
- of course, at the end of the day I wanted to get rid of the attachment, but I also realized that the best way to get rid of attachment and fear is by not trying, because when I try to get rid of something I'm still just reinforcing the hope-fear cycle
	- treating any experience as an enemy, even the feelings that come from deep attachment, only serves to make the feelings stronger
	- rather than being ruled by sadness, anxiety, and insecurity, or making enemies of these emotions, I learned to confront the feelings, observing them just as they are without trying to change anything
- by resting my mind, I noticed that attachment began to gradually release on its own, without my need to interfere at all
- however, this process still took time and I also learned that strong habits are difficult to overcome
- I had to proceed slowly, taking care not to overwhelm myself
- I accepted that these things are up and down, and anything that happens is okay no matter what
