- at this point I started to slip out of the habit of recording journal entries, though I still continued to do meditation
- doing meditation feels natural when I need to give my mind a break, but writing the journal is something I have to schedule in because I write it when I write my own personal daily journal, and if I don't get to it during the day then I often forget what I did
- since I fell out of the habit of writing journals when things started to get busy I also fell out of the habit of writing my meditation journals
