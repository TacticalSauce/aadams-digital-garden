# Meditation Journal Entry for Tuesday, January 31st, 2023

- 19:00 ~ 20:00 (1 hour)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- not lost in thought much, but did dose off 3-4x for about 2 mins at a time
			- noticed sleepiness fairly early on and used a meditation bell to remind myself to keep coming back
		- don't think there were dreams in my sleep, but I think there were thoughts; it's hard to remember actually
		- I was with the breath but felt like my mind was with the breath w out much peripheral awareness; just giving bare awareness to breath, and don't remember experiencing much else
- 22:30 ~ 23:00 (30 mins)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- got lost in thought quite a few times, for maybe 30 secs to 2 mins at a time
- informal meditation examples:
	- a few moments of meditative awareness while walking to the consciousness lecture
	- maintained meditative awareness for short periods a few times during the consciosuness lecture
	- while walking home
	- while eating lunch, asked myself "who/what is it that thinks this food tastes good?" as a reminder
	- while walking to the grocery store and back (espeically while walking back, on the feeling of pain in my shoulders/muscles)
		- pain sensations serve as great reminders for meditation
	- while doing my pre-meditation yoga/stretches
	- while updating yesterday's and today's meditation journals, and while doing typing practise (feeling of my fingers typing, words appearing on the screen)
	- while reading before bed
