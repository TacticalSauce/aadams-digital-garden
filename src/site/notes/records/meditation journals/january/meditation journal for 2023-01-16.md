# Meditation Journal for Monday, January 16th, 2023

- 08:20 ~ 08:30 (10 mins)
	- type: mantra
		- OM, AH, HUNG
	- mind notes:
		- quick meditation; didn't get lost, but nonverbal thoughts/ideas/memories would come and go in the background
		- "at the bus stop" experience of thoughts:
			- by the time I become aware of a thought, it has already passed and the next one is forming in the background
			- by the time I become aware of the next one, it too has already passed, and the cycle repeats
			- (analogous to arriving at a bus stop in between busses)
		- in order not to get caught into a chain of thoughts, I used the mantra as a reminder to maintain broad meditative awareness of anything that occurs
	- philosophical reflections:
		- short intervals of meditation beginning and ending with simply resting the mind as it is seem to lead to the most lucid experiences
		- I was thinking while writing this journal entry that this is likely for the same reason that I find myself less distractable/sleepy when I set an intention to work on an academic assignment in short intervals puncutated by breaks: the mind has a chance to rest and thus I'm less likely to get bored and start wandering or become sleepy and dull
- 14:40 ~ 14:50 (10 mins)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- minatained meditative awareness with the breath as a reminder throughout most of the session, lost in experiences around me and a bit of dullness towards the end 
			- heavy feeling of tiredness in the face and head; yawning
		- awareness of the breath backgrounded by:
			- a song stuck in my head
			- fleeting pieces of conversations I hear from people here in the library
			- people moving about shuffling papers and typing in my visual field
			- thoughts about various ways to summarize Chalmers's points in my précis
			- the aftertaste of my lunch
			- wiggling my toes and moving my leg side to side
			- sporadic unintentional replays and narratives of the various experiences above, likely happening so I could recall them to write about them here in the journal
				- told myself that maintaining meditative awareness should take precedence over writing vivid accounts of my experiences in the journal
- informal meditation examples:
	- coming back to meditative awareness for short intervals (~10-20 seconds) while doing this week's philosophy reading/précis
	- while eating breakfast, I asked myself: who/what is it that thinks this food tastes good?
	- open awareness while on the bus
	- walking meditation on the way to the library (<2 mins)
	- brining awareness to the feeling of my hands while I move my fingers during typing practise
