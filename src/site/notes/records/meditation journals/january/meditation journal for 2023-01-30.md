# Meditation Journal Entry for Monday, January 30th, 2023

- 11:00 ~ 11:20 (20 mins)
	- type: body sensations
	- mind notes:
		- distracted; caught up in random thoughts quite often, for 30 secs to 1 min at a time
		- came back to awareness of the body
		- towards the end of the session I was more consistently aware of the body and got lost in thought for only a few seconds at a time
	- ~~philosophical reflections~~
- 14:30 ~ 14:40 (10 mins)
	- type: open awareness
	- mind notes:
		- clear mind, didn't get lost even once at the beginning
		- but then after almost 10 mins I started to become tired, and the familiar heavy feeling of sleepiness came into the body
			- I watched that feeling too, and was meditating on it with seemingly the same clarity as before
		- however I had a lecture to go to so I got up from my seat before I fell asleep
- 18:40 ~ 18:50 (10 mins)
	- type: Keiran's guided meditation at the meditation club meeting: meditation on the visual field, sense of self, and awareness

- 23:30 ~ 00:20 (20 mins)
	- type: body sensations
