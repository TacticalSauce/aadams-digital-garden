# Meditation Journal Entry for Monday, January 23rd, 2023

- 10:00 ~ 11:00
	- type: body awareness
	- mind notes:
		- listened to guided meditation for some time
		- fairly clear mind, some thoughts came and I got lost into them but for the most part I was brought  back to awareness within a few seconds
		- was on the bus coming back to Kingston
			- felt the vibrations of the bus on my body
			- felt the shift when the bus made turns
			- felt the space of the bus around me as I moved
- ~~informal meditation examples~~
	- couldn't be bothered to write these down
