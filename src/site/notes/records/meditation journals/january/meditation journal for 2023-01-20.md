- (no formal meditation today)
- informal meditation examples:
	- while making/eating breakfast
	- on the bus to campus
	- brief moments of meditative awareness (<20 seconds) 2-3 times during 1 hour chemistry lecture
	- walking meditation going to Chernoff
	- while doing typing practise
		- alternating between movement of my fingers as an object and visual of my arms reaching over the keyboard as an object
	- brief moments while updating the meditation journal / my diary
	- very briefly a couple times during my 3 hour chemistry lab session, but was mostly caught up focused on the lab work to the exclusion of all else
	- walking meditation while walking home
	- while making dinner
	- while packing to go back home to Ottawa
	- while chatting w my roommate
	- body scans while lying down waiting to sleep
