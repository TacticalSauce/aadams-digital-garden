# Meditation Journal Entry for Wednesday, January 25th, 2023

- 14:00 ~ 14:20 (~20 mins)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- meditated for about 20 mins before falling asleep ðŸ˜´ oops!
	- philosophical reflections:
		- sitting in a chair meditating seems to make me more apt to fall asleep than sitting upright on the floor w/ nothing providing back support
		- I noticed that I did sort of give into the feeling of sleepiness, allowing myself to sleep bc of the enjoyable feeling of relaxation sleep offers
			- I told myself I would try and do sleeping meditation to gain awareness in the sleep state, but this seems now to me more like an an excuse to allow myself to dose off rather than getting up and walking around a bit
- informal meditation examples:
	- while making/eating breakfast/lunch
	- while doing some light reading
