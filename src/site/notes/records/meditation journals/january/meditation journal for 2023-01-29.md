# Meditation Journal Entry for Sunday, January 29th, 2023

- 10:20 ~ 10:30 (10 mins)
	- type: sound
	- mind notes:
		- maintained recognition of sound for duration of meditation w/ out getting lost for any notable length of time
		- few thoughts, though I felt that there were likely thoughts in the background which I don't remember, or missed without noticing them
- 13:30 ~ 13:45 (15 mins)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- (felt very similar to session earlier in the day)
- 17:55 ~ 18:00 (5 mins)
	- type: the visual field itself as the object
	- mind notes:
		- (while taking a break from study at the library)
		- maintained awareness of the visual field for the duration of the session
	- philosophical reflections:
		- *what is beyond the visual field?*
		- *the visual field has a certain shape; in what does that shape reside in?*
- informal meditation examples:
	- while making/eating meals
	- walking meditation on the way to the ARC
	- briefly while showering
	- while doing yoga/stretching
	- while playing ping pong
		- felt impatient that my friend was taking so long and I wanted to leave, meditated on the feeling and used it as an opportunity to notice how long irritation lasts in the body / how it affects my thoughts
