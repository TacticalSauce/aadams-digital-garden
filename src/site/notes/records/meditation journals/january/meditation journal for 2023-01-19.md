# Meditation Journal Entry for Friday, January 19th, 2023

- 10:50 ~ 11:00 (10 mins)
	- type: open awareness
	- mind notes:
		- maintained meditative awareness for the duration of the session, while thoughts came and went and my roommate was vacuuming in my visual field
	- ~~philosophical reflections~~
- 13:00 ~ 13:10 (~10 mins)
	- type: visual meditation
		- meditation on the flames in the fireplace in the library reading room
	- mind notes:
		- focused on the flames for ~10 mins, but the dancing flames were seductively peaceful and put me to sleep (had a nice nap thereafter, though)
- 18:00 ~ 18:20 (20 mins)
	- type: breath
	- mind notes:
		- distracted, kept getting lost in thought
		- would remember to come back to breath for a few seconds and intend to stay w/ it but almost immediately forget all about why I'm sitting down
		- eventually my mind settled down but by that time I was hungry and decided to make dinner
	- ~~philosophical reflections~~
- informal meditation examples:
	- while on the bus in the morning
	- while eating breakfast before the meditation lab
	- during meditation class
	- walking meditation while walking home
		- it was cold, and at first I recoiled from the feeling of cold wind and snow on my face but decided to make it an object of meditation
		- alternated between using cold sensations as an object and walking meditation
	- white preparing food and eating once I got home
	- while chatting w/ my friends over lunch
	- walking meditation while walking to prof. Salay's office hours
	- during my chat w/ prof. Salay
		- our conversation was about meditation, so although I was sometimes caught up listening to her I was often reminded to maintain meditative awareness
	- walking meditation while walking home
		- swinging of my feet, sensations on the bottom of my feet, feeling of whole body moving toward my destination, visuals around me
	- while making dinner
	- while watching a show w/ my girlfriend
	- body scans before bed
