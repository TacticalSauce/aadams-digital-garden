# Meditation Journal Entry for Thursday, January 18th, 2023

- 09:00 ~ 09:20 (20 mins)
	- type: mantra
		- OM, AH, HUNG
	- mind notes:
		- maintained the mantra throughout but a few times towards the end I felt myself getting pulled into various random thoughts for a few seconds at a time, was able to remember myself and come back to meditative awareness
	- ~~philosophical reflections~~
- 11:35 ~ 11:40 (5 mins)
	- type: loving-kindness
		- I imagined breathing in a mix of golden vapour and grey/dark smoke, holding the vapour in my body until it became pure golden vapour, and then imagining breathing it out into the world on the outbreath
		- sometimes I imagined the golden vapour / dark smoke was coming from a particular person I know, I'd breathe out the pure golden vapour to them
		- and when a person didn't come to mind I imagined it coming from my ambient surroundings, and breathing it back out into my surroundings
	- mind notes:
		- focused on the meditation, didn't stray away from the exercise
		- since the task of imagination and bringing people to mind is quite active, it felt quite easy to maintain focus on it
		- even as I kept this up I was still able to maintain peripheral awareness of my familiar body sitting on my yoga block and feeling the space around me (my room, also familiar)
- informal meditation examples:
	- while making/eating waffles for breakfast
	- while doing morning stretches
	- while listening to music
	- while eating pizza for lunch (did my usual exercise of asking myself, "who/what is it that thinks this pizza tastes good?")
	- feeling my body and visual awareness while riding the bus to campus
	- while sitting in my chemistry lecture (felt my body sitting in the lecture hall looking at the slides and jotting down notes, the visual and sound of the prof)
	- walking meditation on the way home
	- while studying chemistry, felt my environment, my body in the chair, the movement of my hand writing, awareness of the nonverbal thoughts I was having trying to understand the concepts
	- while watching a show with my girlfriend virtually
	- while brushing my teeth (feeling of the electric toothbrush vibrating, the taste of toothpaste in my mouth)
	- body scanning while lying down to sleep, awareness of tiredness like a chemical moving through my body and making my limbs/head/eyes heavy
