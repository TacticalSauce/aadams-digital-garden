# Meditation Journal Entry for Friday, January 27th, 2023

- 13:10 ~ 13:20 (10 mins)
	- type: objectless
	- mind notes:
		- kept getting lost in thought, but only for 10-30 secs at a time, then I came back to recognizing my mind
		- the thoughts didn't stop when I recognized them, but I watched them impassively as they moved through my mind, like watching a movie
			- when I was lost in thought I was joined in them, as if I was in the movie
		- I also noticed the small gaps between thoughts (what I've been calling the bus stop experience of thoughts), sometimes only for a split second
- informal meditation examples:
	- while stretching in the morning
	- while eating breakfast / drinking tea
	- while eating lunch
	- while walking to my chem lab
	- while playing ping pong
