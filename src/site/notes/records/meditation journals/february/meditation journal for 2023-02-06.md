# Meditation Journal Entry for Monday, February 6th, 2023

- 14:00 ~ 15:00 (1 hour)
	- type: open awareness
	- mind notes:
		- the first half hour was clear and relaxed while maintaining alertness
		- the second half hour I lapsed into dullness
		- I eventually picked an object to try and give myself something more specific to focus on
			- didn't help much, dullness persisted through to the end of the session
