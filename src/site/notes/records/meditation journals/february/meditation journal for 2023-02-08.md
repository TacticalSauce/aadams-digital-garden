# Meditation Journal Entry for Wednesday, February 8th, 2023

- 12:30 ~ 12:50 (20 mins)
	- type: 108 mantra repetitions (counted with my mala), then awareness of body sensations
	- mind notes:
		- sitting at my friends house while she made valentines day cards
			- was peripherally aware of her presence and her movements for the duration of the session
		- it was easy to maintain the mantra, especially with the mala as an object to remind me
			- didn't get caught up in any thoughts
		- when I was meditating on the body I found it slightly harder not to get caught up in thoughts, and I was briefly caught in into a couple thoughts about planning my day
		- did a quick body scan at the beginning of starting the body awareness
			- began at my feet, then felt my legs, the feeling of gravity pressing me into the chair, the feeling of the back of my chair against me, the feelings of my clothes, and a slight pressure in my forehead
			- then let awareness diffuse throughout my whole body, and rested with those sensations as a tether for awareness
		- sometimes I think to myself that I am about to get lost into a thought, and I come back to the body and realize that as long as I am aware of the body, then I am still meditating
	- ~~philosophical reflections~~
- informal meditation examples:
	- while brushing my teeth
	- walking meditation on the way to my friends house
	- brief moments while writing my lab report, sensations of typing, and diffuse awareness as I thought about what to write
	- while doing typing practise
		- sensations in my arms as an object
