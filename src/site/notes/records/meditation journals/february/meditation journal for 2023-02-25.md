- had another lazy day where I watched TV and meditated on and off throughout the whole day
- took a lot of naps too, where I'd start by meditating but then start to get dull and fall asleep, and I'd even continue the meditation lying down to see if I could lucid dream
- sometimes I spend time just doing this in order to get a few lucid dream experiences
- fairly focused meditation at times as well though, mostly breath meditation
