# Meditation Journal Entry for Friday, February 3rd, 2023

*sorry in advance for the long entry!*

- 09:50 ~ 10:00 (10 mins)
	- type: open awareness
	- mind notes:
		- didn't get distracted
	- philosophical reflections:
		- thought I'd take some time to write some of my thoughts on open awareness meditation
		- I'll explain what I've been referring to as open awareness meditation in the journal so far; I also refer to it as "objectless meditation", "nonconceptual meditation", "nonreferential awareness", "resting in the mind's lucidity", because I've read those terms online and they are all referring to the same thing
		- open awareness meditation: resting with whatever is occurring in the mind
			- watching the mind with a child-like nonjudgementality; open to whatever is happening, neither accepting nor rejecting (which are both forms of judgement passed on experience)
			- resting with natural awareness *as it is* is a "state of mind" entirely indifferent to whatever happens to be occurring "within" in
			- awareness is unpurturbed by whatever it apprehends; it simply *is*
			- the best way I can describe nonconceptual meditation is that it's about simply being/resting in the "*is*-ness" of awareness
		- it does **not** mean:
			- allowing the mind to wander aimlessly among memories or daydreams or fantasies, getting caught up however it may do ordinarily
				- for it to be a fruitful practise, I've found that there must still be some presence of mind, a "center of awareness" (without getting too philsophical about a self, which perhaps I'll share my thoughts on in a later reflection)
			- that you have to watch thoughts/emotions/perceptions/feelings in particular; or try to block them, for that matter
		- the only time that the experience shifts from nonconceptuality / from open awareness is when
			1. I attempt to control/change/block/create different perceptions than whatever is occurring naturally
			2. I become so lost/distracted by memories/daydreams/fantasies that I become caught up in them
		- I'll provide some anecdotes about objectless meditation, and about the experience of meditation in general:
			- I like to think of objectless awareness as "pure meditation", or the most basic/fundamental/foundational form of meditation; without additives
			- when I first began practising meditation, I felt like open awareness meditation was far too difficult!
				- looking back, I now see that it was too hard because it was too easy
				- awareness is such an essential, fundamental facet of the natural mind that it's too close to recognize
					- a quote from "*The Matrix*" often comes to mind when I think about this, where morpheus talks about the matrix to Neo for the first time:
						- "The Matrix is everywhere. It's all around us, even in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you pay your taxes. The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes..."
				- seeing awareness is a bit like trying to see your eyebrows without a mirror
					- since it's always there, and so much a part of everyday experience, we come to ignore it and people just live out their lives without much recognizing the natural lucidity that is the background of all their experiences: good, bad, and everything in between
				- I was so used to looking at the world "out there" that I never stopped to recognize the mind that is the basis of all those variety of perceptions
				- the conception of meditation I find most useful to help lead to objectless recognition of awareness is actually one of "non-meditation", which to me suggests a state of dropping altogether a need of "doing" and instead simply "being" - no matter what comes up in experience; there is no need to in particular observe anything, focus on anything, or think anything
					- that said, it *did* help me to gain some insight by asking myself "is there a difference between mind and thoughts that are passing through it?" or "is there a difference between the thinker and the thoughts perceived by the thinker?"
						- as you can imagine, it was quite profound for me to realize that there is no difference between what is seen, and the mind that sees it; what a dramatic shift in perception!
						- instead of seeimg my thoughts/perceptions as fixed realities, since meditating I have begun to recognize that they are just movements of the mind that is thinking them; I have since made something of a life-long commitment to maintaining this recognition
			- I think of all other forms of meditation as essentially just a variety of ways to support the mind in resting in its natural lucidity; they are just variations on the same fundamental practise of coming back to awareness, in order to "attain" the "state" of resting with the mind *as it is*
				- I use quotes around "attain" and "state" because I can remember at first wanting to use meditation to make my mind a certain way which I thought I wanted it to be
				- I had read descriptions of wonderful blissful experiences, wanting that to be my experience too
					- I realized that attachment to any sort of positive experience creates an equally strong force of fear at loosing the experience
					- I realized that this constant dread, stress, and fear was unpleasant; I was constantly under the strain of attempting to make things the way I wanted them to, and not another way
				- I soon found the mindset of holding onto positive experiences and trying to use meditation to get rid of negative ones to be quite counter to what I began to suspect was the real intent behind the decision to meditate: to drop all attachment to any particular experiences and rest in boundless awareness; by that, I mean awareness which is naturally unchanged by whatever it apprehends, and unperturbed by either positive or negative experiences, able to admit anything
					- in other words, I learned that happiness was about accepting and admitting all experiences, just the way they are
				- when I began to understand that, meditation became much easier; my experience shifted from one of grasping at positive experiences and recoiling from negative ones to a more loose sense of curiosity and wonder towards any/all experiences in meditation
					- I welcomed and appreciated positive experiences, but when negative experiences came I began even to welcome those as well, seeing them as opportunities for growth, chances to strengthen a sense of confidence/resilience which isn't rooted in arrogance or attachment to any particular type of experience
					- what were once obstacles to my life / things that brought me down and impeded my ability to live happily became wonderful opportunities
					- this didn't happen all at once; it's a gradual process of becoming aware of habitual patterns and gently guiding things in a different direction, starting with small things, gaining some confidence with those and eventually working up to big things once my level of resilience was great enough to handle them; it should be done systematically and practically, without pushing too hard too fast and being patient, while at the same time being brave and not giving up when thoughts come that this is too hard for me
				- I take no personal credit for this transformation in my experience
					- it was the product of being given good advice, and the good efforts of those who have sought to pass down ancient traditions/teachings in a form which is amenable to people from all backgrounds
					- anything positive I've been able to accomplish has been the sum of their efforts in guiding me
				- I write a lot about informal meditation; this is because after finding the "attitude" described above in meditation, I realized I could approach every single thing in life that way, albeit with some amount of diligent practise and willingness to extend my understanding to situations which would ordinarily be characterized as stressful or unpleasant
					- I realized I had to let go of deep-seated habits of reacting to situations and experiences in a particular way
					- this doesn't occur all at once, and is a gradual process which requires patience, dilligence, and firm resolve; I found that I needed to be brave and unattached to a certain outcome
				- when I began to recognize awareness and the mind in general, my life became somehow richer, and more vivid; once I let go of my ideas about how things should be, I found myself more free to respond to experience exactly as it was and exactly as I was in that moment
				- having practised that way for a few years now, I wonder how I ever got around just living life at the mercy of my habits of thought/perception, entirely ruled by things I was unaware of, caught up by the pulls of pleasure and aversion towards pain; I think that must be part of why people are so keen to teach meditation, because they recognize how much better things would be for the world if people could start to adopt that non-judgemental, open state of mind and bring it to everything they do; of course, some people do it for monetary gain, pride, etc. but I hope the majority of people are simply trying to share the the 
				- meditation is such a profound practise/skill in that it provides a concrete intention to cultivate that state of mind, and it can be applied anywhere/anytime, for as short/long intervals as one is capable of
