- 13:00 ~ 13:40 (40 mins)
	- type: breath meditation
	- mind notes:
		- dull, but I felt a bit preoccupied with my thoughts which would distract me and I'd loose awareness stuck thinking things over and over or ruminating
- informal meditation examples:
	- during meditation club meeting (we didn't do a guided meditation this time)
