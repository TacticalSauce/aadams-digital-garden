- Chris's priorities:
	- camera
		- *pro models have 3x cameras*
		- *otherwise all the rest have 2x cameras*
	- battery life
	- newer = better
	- storage capacity
- models I'm looking at on kijiji (**bold** = meeting already set up, *italics* = waiting for reply / negotiating price):
	- *iPhone 11*
	- **iPhone 12**
	- **iPhone 12 Pro**
	- **iPhone 13**
	- iPhone 14

- my advise
	- prioritize the extra camera over battery life, since you won't notice any more than 1/2 hour diff. between them
	- kijiji rankings (top > bottom):
		- iPhone 12 Pro
		- *if there are no pro models w/ 3x cameras available:*
		- iPhone 13
		- iPhone 11
		- iPhone 12
	- otherwise just buy a 14 pro from Costco
