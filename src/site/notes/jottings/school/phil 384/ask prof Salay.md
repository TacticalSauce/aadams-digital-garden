- should I read private teachings?
- is there a Buddhist monk who talks at length about emptiness, consciousness, albsolute/relative reality, space, time, nature of mind, inherent existence, the self, their own experience with thinking about nature of mind and how they came to understand emptiness? In English?
	- I want to learn from the way they talk about these matters 
- what are your views on reincarnation?
	- what is reincarnated?
	- can there be multiple reincarnations of a single being? Living at the same time?
	- can there be beings who are the first and haven't reincarnated from anyone?
	- how can a memory from a past life be recognized as such?
- what are your views on awareness being 24/7, even in deep sleep
	- blank states of no awareness at all possible?
- what are your views on gaining remarkable abilities like telepathy or clairvoyance?
- what are you views on karma?
- what are your views on the gamma waves monks show when they're hooked up to EEG? do you have personal guesses or ideas as to what causes that or how that works?
- how can I train in awareness through sleep states (sleeping meditation, dream yoga / lucid dreaming, etc)?
- after understanding the basic shift in perception which meditation offers, and continuing to train in recognition which is an ongoing process and a daily practise for me, how can I further my practise and explore my mind on deeper and deeper levels? I'm very curious...
	- maybe we'll get into that in the course?
- how did you first learn about:
	- Buddhism
	- consciousness
- how did you get into cognitive science?
- when you said you've been meditating for 25 years but only been a "serious meditator" for the last 5 years or so, can you expand on that? What do you mean by "serious meditator?"
- do you practise informal meditation?
- what are your thoughts on pancychism / computers having phenomenal consciousness?
	- is it even valid to question where the boundaries of phenomenal consciousness may lie within the physical world? Or are even such questions somehow the product of assumptions which make them invalid to ask?
